    "So far our analysis has been dedicated to Stedman *Triples* on seven bells. It's possible to ring Stedman on different numbers of bells and Stedman *Cinques*, on eleven bells, is more commonly rung to *peals*<sup>1</sup> each year. The structure of Stedman Cinques is very similar to that of triples: each six the front three bells cycle while the others are fixed, and calls affect the back three bells. With more bells ringing it is harder to devise ways to reach particular course ends and so computer searches become more valuable.\n",

    "<sup>1</sup> A peal of Stedman Triples must contain all 5,040 possible rows, and takes around three hours to ring. A peal of Stedman Cinques cannot contain all 39,916,800 possible rows so ringers settle for any length over 5,000."
