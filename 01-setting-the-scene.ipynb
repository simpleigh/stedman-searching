    "\n",
    "[Change ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing) is the art of ringing bells in a sequence of [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) (or *rows*). Ringing occurs on a particular number of bells (or *stage*), and bells are numbered from `1` (the lightest) to `n` (the heaviest). Bells are permuted according to the following rules<sup>1</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* every bell appears in every row exactly once\n",
    "* bells may move a maximum of one position between consecutive permutations\n",
    "* ringing starts and ends in *rounds* (the sequence `1, 2, ..., n`\n",
    "* no *row* may occur more than once in a particular piece of ringing<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Change ringers have devised and named many different systems (or *methods*) in order to generate rows. Here's one such system, named *Plain Hunt Minor*:\n",
